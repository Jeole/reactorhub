Project for Youtube reactors to help avoid copyright issues

Youtube reactors can react to a video without putting copying it in their own video. 
When the reaction is uploaded the reactor provides the url to their reaction, the url of the video they are reacting to, and a list of cue points where different things happen (ie. start the second video, pause the second video, restart the second video, etc.
